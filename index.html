 	    <h3>About Me</h3>
 	    <p>How was your passion driven you into doing amazing things?
  As a second year Computer Science major and Statistics minor at UC Berkeley, I continue to grow as I am learning widely applicable tools that further enable me to create bigger and better projects.
  My passion for problem solving is fueled by challenges as I am consistently optimistic in discovering greater and efficient solutions.
  For instance, one of my recent accomplishments includes developing a backend strategy and algorithm for my first Google Chrome Extension.
  My positive attitude and passion for learning exemplify and generate a sense of adaptability as I am willing to jump in wherever needed.
  I can inspire and generate positivity in others through my enthusiasm and high energy.
  My overall goal entails working with others and creating scalable, productive, and creative solutions.</p></p>
