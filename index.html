                  Hello World!
                  My name is Jack Sullivan and I am a sophomore Computer Science and Statistics majors at the University of California, Berkeley.

                  I began my studies in computation before university with Python and thoroughly enjoyed the sheer scalability of computer programs, using creative problem solving to conquer virtual hurdles, and I especially loved the potential of creating anything (only the imagination is the limit)!
                  In the present day, I have proficient experience in Python, Java, and C while having exposure to SQL, HTML, CCS, and Javascript.
                  Current classwork includes Algorithms, Probability Theory, and Artificial Intelligence classes.

                  In addition to academic interests, I have a wide variety of passions.
                  Playing tennis has been an integral component of my life as I have been playing since I was smaller than a tennis racket.
                  Also, I absolutely love playing video games such as Super Smash Brothers Melee/Wii U and Pokemon.
                  Additionally, I enjoy traveling and going on adventures such exploring Italy's Florence and Santa Margherita last summer!

                      I spent my last summer at the main Tesla factory as a Systems and Analytics Intern for the Human Resources Department.
                      The beginning of this opportunity entailed of quickly picking up and understanding the fundamentals of Workday (Tesla's central employee database) with the purpose of creating headcount data reports.
                      Eventually, I created reports and dashboards (collections of reports) that consisted of headcounts representing crucial employee areas of interest including gender/region versus employee title and a dashboard for managers to view statistics and information on their teams.
                      As I became more versed in Workday, I installed validation rules implanted in employee processes such that errors will be thrown if insufficient information is entered within certain fields (such as employee hourly wage being greater than minimum wage and excluding discontinued locations).
                      In addition, I helped to develop a Python program that would extract key information from offer letter pdfs to ensure that such data corresponded and matched that of their Workday profile.
                      Nearing the end of my internship, I helped transfer certain employee information to Workday through consulting a resume parsing company, utilizing their software to parse every employee's resume, and creating an integration system within Workday to successfully fill in every employee's education, job history, and language fields.

                Worked with a team during Cal Hacks of October 2015 to create a web article summary program through a google chrome extension entitled TL;DR.
                This extension simplifies highlighted article and webpage text into choosable short/medium/long summaries that appear in a window below the extension location.
                My personal role consisted of coding much of the back end of this project, more specifically constructing the word parser and contributed to the algorithm's creation.
                The sentence data was split into various elements in one array and the algorithm chose to display the most important sentences for the summary output based on the summed ranked values of words in each sentence.
                Currently, this extension has approximately 300 active users.
