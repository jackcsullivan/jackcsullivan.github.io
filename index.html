       	    <p>How was your passion driven you into doing amazing things?
        As a second year Computer Science major and Statistics minor at UC Berkeley, I continue to grow as I am learning widely applicable tools that further enable me to create bigger and better projects.
        My passion for problem solving is fueled by challenges as I am consistently optimistic in discovering greater and efficient solutions.
        For instance, one of my recent accomplishments includes developing a backend strategy and algorithm for my first Google Chrome Extension.
        My positive attitude and passion for learning exemplify and generate a sense of adaptability as I am willing to jump in wherever needed.
        I can inspire and generate positivity in others through my enthusiasm and high energy.
        My overall goal entails working with others and creating scalable, productive, and creative solutions.</p></p>
